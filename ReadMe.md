# Project 1: Designing User Studies
1. Make a group of 4 people and make a corresponding wiki page for your team. See the root page of our wiki for instructions.

3. You have ~2 weeks to complete this. To help you gather data you will be assigned 4 other people from one more team as “participants”.

4. A fully executed mini-project includes: (1) submit your results (csv and one plot), (2) film at least 1 complete run of your study (unlisted youtube video) so we can see how your apparatus looked like, (3) present a 5-minute (max!) talk live in class, in which every team member speaks at least ~1 minute (explaining your setup and results).

## Project 1A: robust gestures
https://hciintro22-nakagaki.plopes.org/wiki/doku.php?id=mini-project-1-robust-gestures

1. Design two very different motion based gestures that your users perform with a smartphone (note that you decide what very different means in this context, so think carefully here)).

2. You don't need to trigger complex functionality with the gestures, but you need to detect them using your code. (the gestures do not need to trigger complex functionality, but instead the gestures can trigger something simple, such as playing a sound or flashing the screen with a message).

3. Now, your application should be able to recognize these gestures with an accuracy of at least 70% (or more). Show us how you measured this accuracy.

4. Now you are ready for carefully designing your main user study that finds which of the two gestures is more robust against accidental activation.
Reflect on your findings in your talk. Tell us what you think might explain the results.

## Project Description
There are two motions detected by our phone: 
  1. lovetap
  2. spin
To test Accuracy, we will ask  each participant to punch the phone 10 times and spin the phone 10 times. We will record the results.

To test robustness, we will ask them to perform 2 tasks. For the first task, we will ask participants to walk around the building holding their phone. For the second task, we will ask participants to draw a "C" onto the screen." In both cases we will test whether the motion sensor is triggered.
